# Component Based UI

- examples: `react`, `angular`, `vue`
- a collection of `components` rather than interconnected codebase
- class and functions for functionality
- `state` changes and we react to it

## state

- looks like markup but does a lot of coding on our behalf

- [introducing jsx](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
  - looks like html, but isn't
  - makes `elements`
  - react separates `concerns` rather than technologies
  - jsx not a requirement of react, but a common usage
  - jsx resolves to JS so you can use loops and conditionals
- [rendering elements](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/rendering-elements.html)
  - usually build off single root dom node
  - we can't change elements once attached, but we can re-draw them
